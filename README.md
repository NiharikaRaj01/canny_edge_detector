Semi-modified Canny edge detection algorithm
In computer vision and image processing, edge detection is a vital technique for revealing critical features within images. It identifies areas of sharp contrast in image brightness, highlighting essential features.Edge detection plays a key role in understanding object structure by detecting abrupt intensity changes in images. It is crucial in image analysis, computer vision, human vision, object detection, and pattern recognition.  

Among the plethora of edge detection methods developed thus far, the Canny edge detection algorithm stands out as one of the most rigorously defined methods, known for its ability to provide robust and reliable edge detection.
